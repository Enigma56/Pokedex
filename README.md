# Pokedex
## Overview
<p>
This project was created as part of my boot.dev education. Creating a pokedex and a way to interact with the pokemon universe is how they taught us how to interact with an API and handle JSON data in Golang.
</p>

## Skills Taught
1. JSON Marshal & Unmarshal in Golang
2. Creating a Webserver
3. Consuming 3rd-party API Endpoints
4. Creating basic CLI commands with Golang

## How to play with this project
<p> 
To interact with my code you just have to clone the repo, build the project and use the CLI commands I will list out below. 
</p>
<p> If that does not mean much to you, you can follow the directions below to do exactly this!</p>

### Step 1
<p>Install Golang version >= 1.23 using whichever terminal you typically use</p>

### Step 2
<p>Clone my github repo into a directory of your choosing and <code>cd</code> into it</p>

### Step 3
<p>Build and run this go project with one of the two following methods</p>

1. `go build -o pokedex . && ./pokedex`
2. `go run .`

> Note: The first option builds a binary then runs in. The second option does not build a binary rather compiles then runs the go project
